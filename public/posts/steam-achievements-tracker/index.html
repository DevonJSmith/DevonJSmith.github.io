<h1 id="steam-achievements-tracker">Steam Achievements Tracker</h1>
<p>This is a mobile app built upon the Flutter framework that uses the Steam API. Given a Steam User&rsquo;s vanity URL, it orders all their owned games by percentage of achievements completed in descending order (it filters out games with 100% achievement completion).</p>
<p>The goal of this app is to provide a simple way to see which games are closest to 100% achievement completion for who care about such things, similar to the built in badge progress in the Steam UI.</p>
